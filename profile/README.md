# CAJS PAYROLL SYSTEM  
### A Web-Based Payroll Records and Management Platform

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
The payroll records management system at the newly established **Davao City branch of The Visa Center (Dizon Immigration Services)** currently depends on manual encoding and Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. While spreadsheets provide basic organization, they **lack scalability, automation, and accuracy**, especially as employee data grows.

This project aims to develop an **efficient, secure, and automated payroll management system** that reduces errors, speeds up processing, and supports the branch's operational expansion.
